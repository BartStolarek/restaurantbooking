## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

**That's it!** SQLite is included - no database server needed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd restaurantbooking
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. The database is already configured with SQLite!

The `.env` file is already set up with:
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3010"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
```

4. Database is already set up! âœ…

The SQLite database, migrations, and seed data are already configured.
If you need to reset it:
```bash
npm run db:reset
```

This creates:
- Default manager account: `manager@restaurant.com` / `password123`
- Default staff account: `staff@restaurant.com` / `password123`
- Default customer account: `customer@example.com` / `password123`
- 8 sample tables with various capacities

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) to see the application.

**ðŸŽ‰ You're ready to go!** The application is fully set up with demo data.

## User Roles

### Customer
- Can create bookings online
- Can view and cancel their own bookings
- Must be logged in to make reservations

### Staff
- Can check walk-in availability
- Can view today's bookings
- Can update booking status (seat customers, mark complete)
- Can view table status in real-time

### Manager
- All staff permissions
- Can manage tables (create, update, delete)
- Can view all bookings
- Can access analytics dashboard
- Can export booking data for ML training

## ML Integration

The system is designed to integrate with an external ML prediction API for booking duration estimates.

### Configuration

Set these environment variables:
```env
ML_PREDICTION_API_URL="https://your-ml-api.com/predict"
ML_PREDICTION_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### API Contract

The system sends POST requests with:
```json
{
  "partySize": 4,
  "dayOfWeek": 5,
  "timeOfDay": 19
}
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "duration": 120
}
```

### Fallback Behavior

If the ML API is unavailable or not configured:
- Falls back to heuristic-based estimates
- 2 hours for average party sizes
- Adjusted based on party size (90-150 minutes)

## Database Schema

### User
- Stores customer, staff, and manager accounts
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Role-based access control

### Table
- Restaurant table configuration
- Capacity, number, location, and status
- Status: AVAILABLE, OCCUPIED, RESERVED

### Booking
- Customer reservations and walk-ins
- Status tracking: PENDING â†’ CONFIRMED â†’ SEATED â†’ COMPLETED
- Estimated and actual timing data

### BookingHistory
- ML training data storage
- Actual duration, party size, time patterns
- Exportable via manager analytics dashboard
